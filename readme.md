## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Autentico follows a modular, layered architecture to promote separation of concerns and maintainability. Key components reside within the `pkg/` directory:

- **`config`**: Manages application configuration, loaded at startup.
- **`db`**: Handles database interactions, abstracting SQLite operations.
- **`handler` (within feature packages like `authorize`, `token`, `userinfo`)**: Contains HTTP handlers responsible for request/response processing.
- **`service` (within feature packages)**: Implements the core business logic for each feature.
- **`model`**: Defines data structures and request/response DTOs.
- **`middleware`**: Provides common HTTP middleware like logging, CORS, and CSRF protection.
- **`session`**: Manages user session lifecycle and persistence.
- **`token`**: Handles JWT generation, validation, introspection, and revocation.
- **`user`**: Manages user creation, authentication, and data.
- **`wellknown`**: Serves the OIDC discovery document.

The `main.go` file initializes the configuration, database, and routes, and starts the HTTP server. Static assets like the login page are served from the `view/` directory.

## üîê Endpoints

### OpenID Connect Endpoints

All OAuth/OIDC endpoints are prefixed by `AppOAuthPath` (default: `/oauth2`).

- **Authorization**: `GET /oauth2/authorize`
  - Initiates the OIDC authentication and authorization flow.
- **Token**: `POST /oauth2/token`
  - Exchanges an authorization code (or refresh token) for an access token (and optionally a new refresh token).
- **User Info**: `GET /oauth2/userinfo`
  - Retrieves claims about the authenticated user. Requires a valid access token.
- **Token Revocation**: `POST /oauth2/revoke` (RFC 7009)
  - Revokes an access token or refresh token.
- **Token Introspection**: `POST /oauth2/introspect` (RFC 7662)
  - Checks the validity and metadata of an access token or refresh token.
- **Logout**: `POST /oauth2/logout`
  - Logs out the user by invalidating their session.

### Well-Known Configuration

- **OIDC Discovery**: `GET /.well-known/openid-configuration`
  - Provides metadata about the OIDC provider's configuration, allowing clients to dynamically discover endpoints and capabilities.

### User Management

- **Create User**: `POST /users/create`
  - Registers a new user in the system.

---

## üß™ Supported Flows

Autentico currently supports the following OAuth 2.0 grant types:

- **Authorization Code Flow**:
  - The primary and most secure flow for web applications and native/mobile apps.
- **Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow**:
  - Allows exchanging a user's credentials directly for an access token.
  - **Note**: This flow is generally discouraged for new applications due to security risks but is provided for legacy compatibility or specific trusted client scenarios.
- **Refresh Token Grant**:
  - Used to obtain a new access token using a refresh token.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Client Interaction Examples

Client registration is currently manual. You must add your client application's redirect URI(s) to the `AuthAllowedRedirectURIs` list in the configuration (`pkg/config/config.go`).

### Register a User

Create a new user via the `/users/create` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/users/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "user@example.com", "password": "SecurePassword123!", "email": "user@example.com"}'
```

### Authorization Request

Redirect the user to the `/oauth2/authorize` endpoint to start the login process.

**Using JavaScript:**

```javascript
const authServerUrl = "http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorize";
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  response_type: "code", // For Authorization Code Flow
  redirect_uri: "https://your-client-app.com/callback", // Must be in AuthAllowedRedirectURIs
  scope: "openid profile email", // Standard OIDC scopes
  state: "callback_state", // Recommended
});

window.location.href = `${authServerUrl}?${params.toString()}`;
```

**Using `curl` to construct the URL for manual testing:**

```bash
# Note: This curl command just constructs the URL. You'd then open this URL in a browser.
# Replace placeholders accordingly.
# Ensure the redirect_uri is whitelisted in Autentico's config.

EFFECTIVE_URL=$(curl -G -s -o /dev/null -w "%{url_effective}\n" \
  --data-urlencode "response_type=code" \
  --data-urlencode "client_id=el_autentico_!" \
  --data-urlencode "redirect_uri=https://your-client-app.com/callback" \
  --data-urlencode "scope=openid profile email" \
  --data-urlencode "state=xyz123abc" \
  http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorize)

echo "Open this URL in your browser: ${EFFECTIVE_URL}"
# Example for macOS: open "${EFFECTIVE_URL}"
```

### Token Exchange

After successful authentication, the user is redirected back to your `redirect_uri` with an authorization `code`. Exchange this code for tokens at the `/oauth2/token` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/oauth2/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
  -d "code=your_received_authorization_code" \
  -d "redirect_uri=https://your-client-app.com/callback" \
  -d "client_id=your_client_id"
```

A successful response will contain `access_token`, `id_token`, `refresh_token`, `token_type`, and `expires_in`.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

Security is a primary concern for an authentication server. Autentico incorporates several security practices:

- **HTTPS**: Always deploy Autentico behind a reverse proxy configured with HTTPS in production environments to protect data in transit.
- **Secure Cookies**: Configure `AuthRefreshTokenAsSecureCookie` and `AuthCSRFSecureCookie` to `true` when using HTTPS. This ensures these cookies are only transmitted over secure connections.
- **CSRF Protection**: `gorilla/csrf` is used for endpoints susceptible to CSRF attacks (e.g., login form submissions). Ensure `AuthCSRFProtectionSecretKey` is a strong, unique 32-byte key.
- **Redirect URI Validation**: Autentico strictly validates `redirect_uri` parameters against a pre-configured whitelist (`AuthAllowedRedirectURIs`) to prevent open redirector vulnerabilities.
- **Strong Secret Keys**: Ensure all configured secrets (`AuthAccessTokenSecret`, `AuthRefreshTokenSecret`, `AuthCSRFProtectionSecretKey`) are cryptographically strong and kept confidential.
- **Input Validation**: User inputs (usernames, passwords) are validated according to configured length and format rules.
- **Regular Dependency Updates**: Keep Go and all third-party libraries updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Tokens should be requested with the minimum necessary scopes.

---

## üß™ Testing

Autentico includes a suite of unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and correctness. The `testify` library is used for assertions and mocking.

**Run the test suite:**

```bash
make test
# Or directly using Go:
# go test ./...
```

Tests cover critical functionalities such as:

- Token generation, validation, and revocation.
- User authentication and creation.
- OIDC endpoint behavior (e.g., `/authorize`, `/token`, `/userinfo`).
- Session management.
- Database interactions.

The `tests/` directory contains end-to-end style tests, while package-specific tests reside alongside the source code (e.g., `pkg/token/create_test.go`).
